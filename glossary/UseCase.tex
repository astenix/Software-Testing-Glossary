\section{Use Case}
\label{sec:Use Case}

In software and systems engineering, a \rindex{\textbf{U}!Use Case}\emph{Use Case} is a list of steps, typically defining interactions between a role (known in Unified Modeling Language as an "actor") and a system, to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human, an external system, or time.

In our industry Use Cases become a special form of a \rindex{\textbf{R}!Requirements}Requirement.

We may say that Requirements evolve in Use Cases.

Or~\textemdash~this is another form of Requirements, nothing to worry about it.

Anyway, Use Cases derive from \rindex{\textbf{U}!User Story}User Stories [p.\pageref{sec:User Story}].

Use Cases have been widely used in modern software engineering over the last two decades. With its iterative and evolutionary nature, use case is also a good fit for agile development.

When you have good Use Cases, you will be able to create a lot of good \rindex{\textbf{T}!Test Case}Test Cases.
