Check \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development}, please. There are more nice pictures too.

Iterative Development ModelIterative and Incremental development is any combination of both iterative design or iterative method and incremental build model for software development. This process may be described as an 'evolutionary acquisition' or 'incremental build' approach.

The relationship between iterations and increments is determined by the overall software development methodology and software development process. The exact number and nature of the particular incremental builds and what is iterated will be specific to each individual development effort.

Iterative and incremental development are essential parts of the Modified waterfall models, Rational Unified Process, Extreme Programming and generally the various agile software development frameworks.

It follows a similar process to the 'plan-do-check-act' cycle of business process improvement.
