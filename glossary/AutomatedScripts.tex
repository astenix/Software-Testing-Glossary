\section{Automated Scripts}
\label{sec:Automated Scripts}
The scenario for the Automation Robot.

Shows how to interact with the application under testing.

Usually a simple human cannot read/understand such scripts, but there are a lot of exceptions. Scripts can be writted in a simulation of normal language. 

You don't know, how the Robot will read and execute step by step this instruction, but you can understand at a global scale, what should be happen at each step.
