\label{sec:Staging}

In theater a \index{Stage}Staging is  the platform on which actors perform their 'To be, or not to be\ldots' So, this is a place, where something is shown to an appreciative audience. 

A 'staging server' is any server that stores the software with testing purposes, but the environment is almost production-similar. 

Usually only client-side testers have access to Staging server, where they can, for example, use real Credit Card for testing.

And customer usually check the software on the staging server, not on testing server.

Sometimes this thing is called \index{UAT, User Acceptance Testing}UAT~\textemdash~User Acceptance Testing.
