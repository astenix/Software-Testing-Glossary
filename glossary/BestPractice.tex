\section{Best Practice}
\label{sec:Best Practice}


This is the worst thing, that you can get from something (or someone) and try to adapt it at your needs. There are no best practices, everything depends of the context. You cannot get the most valuable from the \index{Capitalism}Capitalism and \index{Communism}Communism, and mix it in a new religion for your own project.

What is the best in Capitalism is immediately available with its worst things, and this things cannot be separated, like Mercedes cannot be separated from 'german approach of doing cars'. Just imagine the building of Mercedes in Russia.

What is the best for one crew, can be crucial badly for any other.

Simple, honest alternatives to 'Best practices' are available:

\begin{itemize}
 \item     “Here’s what I would recommend for this situation...”
 \item     “Here is a practice I find interesting...”
 \item     “Here is my favorite practice for dealing with {x}...”
 \item     “{Person $X$} attributes {practice $Y$} for his success. Maybe you’d like to learn about it...”
\end{itemize}

Saying <<best practice>> is obviously irresponsible.
