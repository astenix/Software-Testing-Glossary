\section{Continuous Integration (CI)}
\label{sec:Continuous Integration (CI)}

\index{Continuous Integration (CI)}In software engineering this is a practice of merging all developer working copies with a shared mainline several times a day.

It was first named and proposed as part of extreme programming (XP). Was originally intended to be used in combination with automated unit tests written through the practices of test-driven development.

Initially this was conceived of as running all unit tests and verifying they all passed before committing to the mainline. This helps avoid one developer's work in progress breaking another developer's copy. If necessary, partially complete features can be disabled before committing using feature toggles.

Continuous integration isn't universally accepted as an improvement over frequent integration.
