\section{Test Scenario}
\label{sec:Test Scenario}

\rindex{\textbf{T}!Test Scenario}The simplest explanation about what steps need to be taken in order to create expected test situation to verify a software requirement without getting into specific detailed test steps, test data, and/or expected results.

Example: "\textit{How to put an elephant into a refrigerator?}" 

    \begin{enumerate}
\item open the fridge door,
\item put the elephant in a refrigerator, 
\item close the refrigerator door.
\end{enumerate}

Sometimes waste, complex \rindex{\textbf{T}!Test Case}test cases are preceded by test scenarios.

And it is obvious, that every test case aggregate a test scenario (step one, step two, step three\ldots)
