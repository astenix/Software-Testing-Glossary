\rindex{\textbf{I}!Integration Testing}Integration testing is a process, where different parts of system under testing are engaged one by another.

Such testing is done to ensure that all engaged components (may be included third-parties) maintain data integrity and can operate in coordination with other system artifacts in the same environment.

This type of testing is performed to expose defects in the interfaces and in the interactions between integrated components or systems. There are a huge possibility, that each software component can be bugless apart, but on the integration phase can appear some bugs, that cannot be imagined, supposed and identified. They can be discovered only at the Integration testing phase.
