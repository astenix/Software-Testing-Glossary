\label{sec:Requirement}

\index{Requirements}A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document.

\index{Specifications}Specification is the next step after Requirement. Requirements tells what to do, and Specification tells how to do it â€” this can be two different docs.
