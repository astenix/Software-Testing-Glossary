Understand what is a \index{Criteria}Criteria first [p.\pageref{sec:Criteria}].
\end{quote} 

An \index{Acceptance criteria}\emph{Acceptance criteria} is a set of expectations.

\textbf{Example}: '\textit{Yes, it works exactly as I expected! Shut up and take my money!}'.

\textbf{Main idea}: the \emph{Acceptance Criteria} should be established directly by the user (or customer, or any other authorized entity), charged with authority to approve or reject, otherwise the whole idea has no sense. \begin{quote}
Expectations must be satisfied by development team in order to be accepted by their customer. 

So, who can/should establish them instead of \index{Customer}Customer?\end{quote}

Fun is that a Customer has no needs of any requirements or even acceptance criterias — the development team required them. If nobody understand this simple issue — your project can slide to hell.
