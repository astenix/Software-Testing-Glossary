\index{Domain Analysis}A very mature test design technique.

Used to identify efficient and effective test cases when multiple variables can or should be tested together.

Implies a lot of equivalence partitioning and boundary values analysis, so a junior tester will never be able to do it.

Not every Senior Tester is familiar with this advanced approach to design test cases either.

Sad but true.
