\index{End-to-end Testing}A convenient expression for establish the complexity of system being to test and the nature of test cases, designed for this.

Consider a platform, where individual component systems are integrated with each other, so a new shop (a new system) can be created without having to develop applications from new. Complexity of such software requires to test whether the flow of an application is performing as designed from start to finish.

Example â€” Promotions. Every step can be tested apart, but it is more important to be sure that the whole process (create and apply new Promotion) works as expected.

The purpose of carrying out end-to-end tests is to identify system dependencies and to ensure that the right information is passed between various system components and systems.

Someone can act such type of testing like very annoying. Well, complex thing requires complex testing.
