\end{quote} 

\index{Entry criteria}\emph{Entry and Exit criteria} are the conditions which when satisfies, the test team starts (enters) the testing process and stops (exits) it.

\index{Suspention criteria}\emph{Suspension and Resumption criteria} are the conditions which when satisfies, the test team temporarily suspends (suspension) the testing process and resumes (resumption) it.

A test process may have to be suspended temporarily until the show stopper \index{Bug}bugs are resolved.
