\rindex{\textbf{R}!Checklist-based Testing}Stupid term, but it is very human\ldots

If you need to dig a hole in the mother Earth, you will need a spade. And the process of creating a hole will be called 'to dig', not something like 'spade digging'. Because it doesn't matter, how you will dig a hole. You will use a spade, of course. Or your hands.

When you will use in testing a checklist, this is still the same testing, right?!

But if you want to feel yourself less dumb, you can say, that you will use the \textbf{Checklist-based Testing}. Something unusual! Something great! A new type of testing!

And if someone will interfere, just tell him following magic words: \russianq{\textit{A checklist-based Testing is a test design technique whereby the experienced tester uses a high-level list of items to be noted, checked, or remembered, or a set of rules or criteria against which a product has to be verified. Step aside, whiffet!}}

All the chicks will starve to death admiring you, my ass.
