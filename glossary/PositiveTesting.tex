\section{Positive Testing}
\label{sec:Positive Testing}

This is nothing else than the \rindex{\textbf{P}!Positive Testing}main approach to testing.

Our main intention is to prove that an application will work 'as expected' on giving valid input data.

In \rindex{\textbf{N}!Negative Testing}Negative testing ([p.\pageref{sec:Negative Testing}]) our intention is to prove that positive testing did not cover some situations.

Suppose following situation: I will type an email address without '@', system should alert me about my error. What kind of testing type is that? Is that A positive or a negative one?
