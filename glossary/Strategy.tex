\rindex{\textbf{S}!Strategy} \rindex{\textbf{W}!War}It is a very ancient word, means "\texttt{art of military troops leader}". 

It comes from the science (and art) of military command exercised to meet the enemy in combat under advantageous conditions for our glorious troops and disadvantageous conditions for our disgraceful enemy.

And our enemy tries to do the same. Like in a chess game.

Strategy is important because the resources available to commandment are usually limited.

Strategic planning and strategic thinking involves 
\begin{itemize}
\item 
setting goals, 
\item determining a general pattern of actions to achieve the goals, 
\item and mobilizing resources to execute the actions.                                                \end{itemize}

You don't really know how this goal will be achieved, because it is a matter of the \emph{Tactics}.
