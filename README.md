# Software Testing Glossary

A damn simple definition dictionary from testitquickly.com

See the „[Software Testing Glossary (Alexei Lupan).pdf](https://github.com/astenix/Software-Testing-Glossary/blob/master/Software%20Testing%20Glossary%20(Alexei%20Lupan).pdf)“ file.

This is not an another ’_Full glossary of terms used in Software Testing_’. I just had to notice my own definition dictionary of some terms, so I did it. 

English is not my pet language, so any ping about ANY inaccuracy in this doc wil be appreciated. Thank you in advance.

Also you can:
- download a new version of this pdf for free from this repo [bit.ly/2SLVYfz](bit.ly/2SLVYfz) (SCREEN version of this doc is in _master_ and PRINT version is in _print_version_ branch),
- ask me, if something wrong or unclear,
- understand, that some terms require a detailed explanation, which is a subject of a whole lesson, apart from of a glossary,
- use and share this doc in any way but not with any commercial purposes.
