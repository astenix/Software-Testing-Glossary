This is not an another '\textit{Full glossary of terms used in Software Testing}', or '\textit{Let's bring together every known term in our industry, because everyone needs it\ldots}'.

I just had to notice my own \emph{definition dictionary} of some terms, so I did it.

English is not my pet language, so any ping about ANY inaccuracy in this doc wil be appreciated. Thank you in advance.

Also you can:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
download a new version of this pdf for free from \url{http://wp.me/pfyTc-W4}.
\item
ask me, if something wrong or unclear.
\item
understand, that some terms require a detailed explanation, which is a subject of a whole lesson, apart from of a glossary.
\item 
use and share this doc in any way with no commercial purposes.
\end{enumerate}
