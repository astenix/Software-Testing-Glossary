This is not an another '\textit{Full glossary of terms used in Software Testing}', or '\textit{Let's bring together every known term in our industry, because everyone needs it\ldots}'.

I just had to notice my own \emph{definition dictionary} of some terms, so I did it.

English is not my pet language, so any ping about ANY inaccuracy in this doc wil be appreciated. Thank you in advance.

\item
ask me, if something wrong or unclear,
\item
understand, that some terms require a detailed explanation, which is a subject of a whole lesson, apart from of a glossary,
\item 
use and share this doc in any way but not with any commercial purposes.
